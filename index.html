<h2>Project 1: 2D Digital Design (Southworth Planetarium Logo)</h2>
<p>&#11088;&#127769;</p>
<p><ul><li>Project Statement: This illustraion was designed as a potential logo for the University of Southern Maine's Southworth Planetarium.<br>
There is a husky (the mascot of USM) face in the middle of the circle surrounded by three stars, one on the top and one on each side of the dog.<br>
It uses the official university colors, gold and navy blue for the stars and background.</li><br><li>Program Used: Adobe Illustrator</li><br></ul></p>
<p>Here are the 2 versions of the final logo:</p>

<h3>Project 2: Photo Manipulation (Spider-Bee Cryptid)</h3>
<p>&#128375;&#128029;</p>
<p><ul><li>Project Statement: For this project, five seperate images were combined to create one composite image.<br>
There is a spider with bee wings in the middle of a web surrounded by dried lotus pods in the foreground, and a fly in the upper portion of the composition.<br>
The image has a monochromatic black and white filter which gives it a spooky atmosphere.</li><br><li>Program Used: Adobe Photoshop</li><br></ul></p>

<a href="https://github.com/EmmaJZE/Emma-Estes-Digital-Art-Portfolio/tree/main/project%202%20cryptid%20photo%20manipulation">This folder contains the 5 images used to create 1 composite image.</a>
<p>Here is the final image of all 5 images combined:</p>

<h4>Project 3: Video Art (Hydra)</h4>
<p>&#128009;&#128013;</p>
<p><ul><li>Project Statement: Two videos were cut and spliced together to create one video.<br>
The final video is in black and white with no sound.<br>
In the beginning, a title card with the words, "The Living Cell" are shown followed by a sequence of a mircoscope zooming in to the titular character the Hydra.<br>
The rest of the film switching between shots of a hydra cell and of a cartoo dinosaur which is assumed to also be named Hydra. <br>
</li><br><li>Program Used: Adobe Premiere Pro </li><br></ul></p>

<h5>Project 4: Interactive Projection (Origami Cranes)</h5></h>
<p>&#128196;&#127959;</p>
<p><ul><li>Project Statement: For this last project, coding and video editing were combined to create an interaction projection.<br>
The input AKA a sensor was coded so that when motion was detected a video would play of a piece of paper being folded into an origami crane.<br>
Ideally, the auidence member would fold along with the film (digital twinning).<br>
</li><br><li>Program Used: Adobe Premiere Pro, Arduino IDE, and Touch Designer</li><br></ul></p>
